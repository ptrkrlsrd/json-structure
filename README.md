## Example 
Note: The output is a not 100% valid JSON. I might optimize this or another format at a later stage.
``` json
[
  {
    "winery": "string",
    "wine": "string",
    "rating": {
      "average": "string",
      "reviews": "string"
    },
    "location": "string",
    "image": "string",
    "id": "number"
  }
]
```
